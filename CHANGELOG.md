# Changelog

## 0.1.0 - 2026-09-12

- First tagged source release of the reusable GitHub Actions workflows.
- Document the additional native Venus OS checks required for service installers:
  BusyBox compatibility, persistent paths, repeat installs, offline dependencies,
  bounded logging and target Python/architecture compatibility.

Passing host CI does not establish device compatibility. This repository provides
CI workflows, not a GX runtime package. Consumers pinned to an immutable commit
remain on that commit until explicitly updated.
